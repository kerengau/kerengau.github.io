Marketing Campaign Materials that I designed and presented in a Digital Marketing course in 2024 for a local small business.

Description

This project is a strategic and data-driven marketing campaign created to increase brand awareness and customer engagement. The materials include visually appealing social media graphics, a detailed content calendar, and a comprehensive market analysis report that outlines clear goals and measurable outcomes. The campaign was developed for a local small business client who wanted to expand its online presence and attract new customers.

I collaborated closely with the client to understand their target audience and brand identity before creating the final materials. I am proud of this project because it demonstrates my creativity, analytical skills, and ability to deliver professional results that meet a client’s needs.</p>
